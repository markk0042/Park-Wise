# Finding the Update/Save Button on Railway

## Where to Look

The save button might be in different places:

### Option 1: Top Right Corner
- Look at the **top right** of the page
- You might see:
  - **"Update"** button
  - **"Save"** button
  - **"Deploy"** button
  - **"Save Changes"** button

### Option 2: Sticky Header
- The button might be **stuck to the top** of the page
- Even when you scroll, it stays visible
- Look for a button in the header/toolbar

### Option 3: Bottom Right
- Scroll all the way down
- Look at the **bottom right corner**
- Might be a floating button

### Option 4: After Each Section
- Some Railway pages save automatically
- Or have "Save" buttons after each section
- Check if changes are auto-saving

### Option 5: Check if Already Saved
- Railway might auto-save as you make changes
- Look for a green checkmark or "Saved" message
- If auto-saving, you might not need a button!

## What to Do

1. **Make all your changes first:**
   - Set Root Directory: `anpr-service`
   - Set Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Set Start Command: `python anpr.py`
   - Set Memory: 1 GB
   - Generate Domain

2. **Then look for:**
   - Any button that says "Update", "Save", "Deploy", or "Apply"
   - Or check if Railway auto-saved (green checkmark)

3. **If you can't find a button:**
   - Railway might auto-deploy when you make changes
   - Check the "Deployments" tab to see if it's deploying
   - Or try refreshing the page

## Alternative: Check Deployments Tab

1. Look for a **"Deployments"** tab at the top
2. Click it
3. You might see a **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"** button there

## Can You Tell Me:

- Do you see any buttons at the top right?
- Is there a green checkmark or "Saved" message?
- What tabs do you see at the top? (Settings, Deployments, Metrics, etc.)
- Are your changes staying when you refresh?

This will help me give you exact instructions!
