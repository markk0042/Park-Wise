# Railway $5 Monthly Credits - Explained

## What Are Monthly Usage Credits?

**Railway gives you $5 free credit every month** that you can use for:
- RAM usage
- CPU usage
- Storage
- Bandwidth
- Any Railway services

## How It Works

### Example: Your ANPR Service

**Your service uses:**
- 0.7GB RAM × $10/GB = $7/month
- 0.5 vCPU × $20/vCPU = $10/month
- **Total: $17/month**

**But:**
- Railway gives you $5 credit
- $17 - $5 = **$12/month you pay**

**If you use less:**
- 0.5GB RAM × $10 = $5/month
- Railway gives you $5 credit
- **Total: $0/month (FREE!)** ✅

## Credit System

- ✅ **$5 credit resets every month**
- ✅ **Unused credits don't roll over**
- ✅ **Credits apply automatically**
- ✅ **Only pay for what you use above $5**

## Real Cost Examples

### Light Usage (Within $5 Credit)
- 0.5GB RAM = $5/month
- Credit covers it = **$0/month** ✅

### Medium Usage (Your ANPR)
- 0.7GB RAM = $7/month
- Credit covers $5 = **$2/month** ✅

### Heavy Usage
- 2GB RAM = $20/month
- Credit covers $5 = **$15/month**

## Does Railway Support Multiple Languages?

### Supported Languages:
- ✅ **Python** (your ANPR service)

- ✅ **Go**
- ✅ **Ruby**
- ✅ **Java**
- ✅ **Rust**
